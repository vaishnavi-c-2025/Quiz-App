# Quiz-App
 A mini-project on creating a Quiz App

 I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a Quick Quiz App. Initially, the questions were stored in an array format in the game.js file. To improve the readability, I have stored the questions in a JSON file and these questions are fetched using the fetch method. In order to reduce the complexity of typing and storing many questions, I have used the Open Trivia Database API, in which the questions are readily available.
